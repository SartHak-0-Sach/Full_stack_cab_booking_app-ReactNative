## My process

### Built with

- React Native
- Expo Router
- Tailwind CSS
- PostgreSQL
- Stripe

### What I learned

Building this platform taught me the importance of optimizing database queries to handle high-traffic scenarios efficiently and creating a smooth, user-friendly payment system.

### Continued development

I plan to further enhance the platform's real-time capabilities and explore machine learning techniques to optimize ride matching and pricing.
